**Outlier detection and removal using Z Score**


Z score indicates how many standard deviation away a data point is.For example, suppose, in our case mean is 66.37 and standard deviation is 3.84.And our value of a data point(x) is 77.91 then Z score for that is 3 because it is 3 standard deviation away (77.91 = 66.37 + 3 * 3.84)

Z Score = x - mean / standard deviation
